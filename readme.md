## ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?

Using 335 logs randomly selected from all the logs uploaded to WCL early in the 25th of March, 2023, I extracted data for 54 Algalon and 208 Kologarn kills to look into demonic pact spellpower along the encounters.

## Data Selection

The spellpower that I extracted for each log is from the first rogue listed in the Actors Table of that log. While the selection process could be refined to better standardize different trinket procs, raid performance and demo lock performance, this should be enough data to have a rough idea of the trend on it.

On average, the Kologarn kills lasted 112s [SD: 22] and the Algalon kills lasted 312s [SD:43]


## Overall distribution

There is definitively, on average, higher demonic pact spellpower on the first 50s or so of a fight

## Comparison 50s into the pull vs rest of the fight 

To add a bit more of context on this data, you can summarise the spellpower gain from demonic pact in two groups:

**APPROACH A**
- After the 5s mark, before the 50s mark
- After the 50s mark

**APPROACH B**
- Before 50s mark
- After the 50s mark

The reason for using two approaches at estimating the average spellpower of demonic pact "on pull" is due to the first couple seconds of the fight being effectively "0 spellpower". So whether you consider or not those first 5 seconds of the pull as part of "the average spellpower your demo lock provides to you", is up for discussion and up to you really idk don't ask me.

## Tl;DR

**Yes, demonic pact is higher on the first 50s of a fight. As we expected.** It is nice and good to see the data directly though.
